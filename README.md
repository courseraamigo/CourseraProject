CourseraProject
===============

My final project on 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course from Coursera

Set your working directory in R to the directory of the data (UCI HAR Dataset). Run the first script 'run_analysis.R'. The variable 'newdata' is now in your working environment.
The second tidy data set of point 5 of the project is created running the second script 'projectpoint5.R'. This one creates an local data frame 'neworderdata'.
